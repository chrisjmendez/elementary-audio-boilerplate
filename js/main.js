// intended to be run by the simple cli tool provided in the repository.
//
// Because we know that our cli will open the audio device with a sample rate of 44.1kHz,
// we can simply create a generic Renderer straight away and ask it to render our basic
// example.
//
// The signal we're generating here is a simple sine tone via `el.cycle` at 440Hz in the left
// channel and 441Hz in the right, creating some interesting binaural beating. Each sine tone is
// then multiplied by 0.3 to apply some simple gain before going to the output. That's it!
